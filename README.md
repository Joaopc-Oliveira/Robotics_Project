KUKA Robot Writing Project

This repository contains an experimental KUKA Robot Language (KRL) project focused on making a KUKA robot write letters on a flat surface using a pen attached to the end effector.

The robot generates characters through simple Cartesian motions, similar to a plotter.

Goals

Practice KRL programming

Work with TOOL and BASE frames

Convert text input into robot motion

Test programs on a real robot or with KUKA OfficeLite

Status

Work in progress.
